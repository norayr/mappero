Description: Add location information to your pictures
 Mappero Geotagger is a graphical tool to add geolocation information to your
 pictures (JPEG, camera raw files and any other file supported by libexiv2).
 You can manually drag the pictures on a map, or correlate their timing with a
 GPX track generated by a GPS receiver.
