DEPENDENCIES
============

In order to be able to build mappero, you will need:

- Qt 4.8 or higher (Qt 4.7 might also work)

- QtDesktopComponents:
  https://qt.gitorious.org/qtplayground/qtdesktopcomponents
  (use the "master" branch)

- libexiv2: http://www.exiv2.org/ (for Mappero Geotagger)

- pkg-config: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/


BUILDING
========

The recommended way of building Mappero is to open its project file
(mappero.pro) in Qt Creator and building it from there. Make sure that the
pkg-config executable is in one of the directories listed in the PATH
environment variable.

Alternatively, you can build mappero from the command line: from the top-level
source directory, run

  qmake && make

This should generate a binary called "mappero" under src/qt, which is the main
executable for the project.


RUNNING
=======

Just running the "mappero" executable will start the mapping application; if
you want to run Mappero Geotagger, you'll need to add the "--geotag" parameter
when launching the application (you can add it to the "Arguments" field in the
Qt Creator project's Run settings).


INSTALLING
==========

For Windows and Mac OS X, no installation step is provided, as the process of
installing an application in these platform is not trivial and involve either
creating an installation application or an installation package.
To install Mappero on Linux, just run the

  make install

command as root, which will install the application and its .desktop file.
Since this command will also install the application icons, it's recommended
that you run

  update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/hicolor/

(again, as root) in order to update the system's icon database.
