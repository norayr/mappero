  <summary>Add location information to image files</summary>

  <description>
    <p>Mappero Geotagger is a geotagging application: it allows you to assign a
      geographic location to your photos. The location information is embedded
      following a standard format in the picture file itself, so that you won't
      lose it if you need to move the file around; and if you upload it to 
      Flickr or other services which support the EXIF standard, other people
      will be able to find your pictures just by browsing a map.</p>

    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatic downloading of maps from OpenStreetMap.</li>
      <li>Visualize existing location information by showing your photos on a map.</li>
      <li>Set or modify geolocation information by dragging pictures on the map.</li>
      <li>Visualization of GPX and KML GPS tracks.</li>
      <li>Automatic assignment of location information by correlating the time
        of the photos with the times of a GPX track (this process is often
        called <em>correlation</em>).</li>
      <li>Graphic visualization of the photos on the map during the GPX
        correlation operation, with controls to specify time zone offset and
        fine-grained time adjustment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mappero Geotagger supports all file formats supported by libexiv2.</p>
